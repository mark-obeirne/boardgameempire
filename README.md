## Summary
Boardgame Empire is an online boardgame retailer, which specialises in helping customers discover new games easily.

## Background
The boardgame industry is more than just Monopoly, Cluedo, Scrabble, and The Game of Life; games that many people grew up with and, in some cases, ended up hating! 

In 2017, it was estimated that the global market value of boardgames, otherwise known as tabletop games, was $7.2 billion. That is forecast to grow to [approximately $12 billion by 2023](https://www.statista.com/statistics/829285/global-board-games-market-value/). 

That figure is made up of more than sales of old favourites. In 2016, more than 3,900 new boardgames were released! Boardgames are also becoming more diverse, accessible, and inclusive than ever. There is a growing focus on family-friendly and child-friendly games, rulebooks no longer default to male pronouns, and more YouTube channels have popped up to offer rule explanations and video playthoughs. There has been a growth in boardgame conventions over the years, drawing thousands of visitors to exhibition halls around the world who take in new games, play with friends and strangers alike, and hear from those behind the games themselves.

In recent years, boardgame designers have turned to Kickstarter to help get their games produced. Players have embraced this business decision with pledges growing massively in recent years, from $84.6 million in 2015 to $233.8 million this year. Of this substantial figure, almost $13 million was raised by Frosthaven alone with a further $8.8 million being pledged towards the development of a modular gaming table.

## Aim of the Site
Discovering boardgames, and what one might enjoy, can be a tricky endeavour. It often requires cross-site research and time spent digging through rule books, reviews, and forums...

The aim of Boardgame Empire is to make this process a little more streamlined. On each product page, customers are presented with YouTube videos, which show the game in action. One will typically be a playthrough among a group so customers get an impression of how it plays and how enjoyable it is. The other acts as an explanation of the game, its setup, rules, and mechanics, just in case they're going to shoulder the responsibility of explaining it to their group. 

While customers are presented with ways to find specific products - searching, browsing by theme or mechanics of interest, or browsing generally - we make an effort to help customers find games that may be of interest. Each month, Boardgame Empire highlights a game of the month, occasionally features certain publishers or designers, showcases the most popular game on the site, and offers a navigation option to check out a random game. Rather than being a chore, we want to make the experience one of joy and discovery. 

## Scope
Boardgame Empire's primary target market is boardgame enthusiasts. We hope to encourage frequent purchases by offering a loyalty point programme, while the ability to leave reviews may encourage customers to share knowledge and opinions with other customers. However, Boardgame Empire aims to make boardgames more accessible to those looking for gift ideas, or who are open to the idea of playing something fun with a group of friends who wouldn't describe themselves as boardgamers.

## Site Features
### Slider
Boardgame Empire's homepage features a slider, which can be used to highlight topical games, publishers and designers, ongoing sales, the game of the month, and more. This feature makes it possible to suggest a starting point for a customer who may not be sure what they are looking for.

### Random Game
To aid in a customer's journey of discovery, Boardgame Empire features a random boardgame button as part of the top navbar, which is available at all times. This brings the user to the details page of a random product, which showcases game details, an outline of what the game is, and the YouTube videos to show the game being played and explained.

### Search
For customers who have something particular in mind, Boardgame Empire offers a search mechanic. This can be used to search for a boardgame, a designer or a publisher. 

### Wishlists
If a customer stumbles upon a product of interest, it is possible to add it to their wishlist, provided they are logged into their account. This wishlist feature also highlights if a product is on sale, so a user can add a product and wait until the price is right to purchase it. This wishlist can be managed on a product by product basis or the customer can delete the wishlist in its entirity.
