## Summary
Boardgame Empire is an online boardgame retailer, which specialises in helping customers discover new games easily.

## Background
The boardgame industry is more than just Monopoly, Cluedo, Scrabble, and The Game of Life; games that many people grew up with and, in some cases, ended up hating! 

In 2017, it was estimated that the global market value of boardgames, otherwise known as tabletop games, was $7.2 billion. That is forecast to grow to [approximately $12 billion by 2023](https://www.statista.com/statistics/829285/global-board-games-market-value/). 

That figure is made up of more than sales of old favourites. In 2016, more than 3,900 new boardgames were released! Boardgames are also becoming more diverse, accessible, and inclusive than ever. There is a growing focus on family-friendly and child-friendly games, rulebooks no longer default to male pronouns, and more YouTube channels have popped up to offer rule explanations and video playthoughs. There has been a growth in boardgame conventions over the years, drawing thousands of visitors to exhibition halls around the world who take in new games, play with friends and strangers alike, and hear from those behind the games themselves.

In recent years, boardgame designers have turned to Kickstarter to help get their games produced. Players have embraced this business decision with pledges growing massively in recent years, from $84.6 million in 2015 to $233.8 million this year. Of this substantial figure, almost $13 million was raised by Frosthaven alone with a further $8.8 million being pledged towards the development of a modular gaming table.

## Aim of the Site
Discovering boardgames, and what one might enjoy, can be a tricky endeavour. It often requires cross-site research and time spent digging through rule books, reviews, and forums...

The aim of Boardgame Empire is to make this process a little more streamlined. On each product page, customers are presented with YouTube videos, which show the game in action. One will typically be a playthrough among a group so customers get an impression of how it plays and how enjoyable it is. The other acts as an explanation of the game, its setup, rules, and mechanics, just in case they're going to shoulder the responsibility of explaining it to their group. 

While customers are presented with ways to find specific products - searching, browsing by theme or mechanics of interest, or browsing generally - we make an effort to help customers find games that may be of interest. Each month, Boardgame Empire highlights a game of the month, occasionally features certain publishers or designers, showcases the most popular game on the site, and offers a navigation option to check out a random game. Rather than being a chore, we want to make the experience one of joy and discovery. 

## Scope
Boardgame Empire's primary target market is boardgame enthusiasts. We hope to encourage frequent purchases by offering a loyalty point programme, while the ability to leave reviews may encourage customers to share knowledge and opinions with other customers. However, Boardgame Empire aims to make boardgames more accessible to those looking for gift ideas, or who are open to the idea of playing something fun with a group of friends who wouldn't describe themselves as boardgamers.

## Site Features
### Slider
Boardgame Empire's homepage features a slider, which can be used to highlight topical games, publishers and designers, ongoing sales, the game of the month, and more. This feature makes it possible to suggest a starting point for a customer who may not be sure what they are looking for.

### Random Game
To aid in a customer's journey of discovery, Boardgame Empire features a random boardgame button as part of the top navbar, which is available at all times. This brings the user to the details page of a random product, which showcases game details, an outline of what the game is, and the YouTube videos to show the game being played and explained.

### Search
For customers who have something particular in mind, Boardgame Empire offers a search mechanic. This can be used to search for a boardgame, a designer or a publisher. 

### Wishlists
If a customer stumbles upon a product of interest, it is possible to add it to their wishlist, provided they are logged into their account. This wishlist feature also highlights if a product is on sale, so a user can add a product and wait until the price is right to purchase it. This wishlist can be managed on a product by product basis or the customer can delete the wishlist in its entirity.  

### Loyalty Points Programme
Customers have a variety of online and brick-and-mortar stores to choose from when purchasing boardgames. In order to encourage customers to return in the future for further purchases, Boardgame Empire offers a Loyalty Point programme. Customers earn points on their purchase, which they can use at checkout on a future purchase for a discount. 

### Order History
Provided a user has made a purchase from a Boardgame Empire account, they will be able to view the order's details and click into it for more information from their profile page.

### Reviews
Once logged in, a user can submit a review of a product and rate it on a scale of 1-5. The most recent reviews are displayed beneath a product on its details page with further reviews available to read on a dedicated page for that product. It has been decided not to limit this to customers who have ordered the product via the store initially in order to build up reviews and ratings, which other customers could find beneficial. 

### Contact Page
The Contact Us page contains a form, which will send an email to the Boardgame Empire email address with the user's query and provided details. Once the email is sent, the user is directed to a success page and can navigate to the store from there.

## Future Features
### Sort By Ratings
Boardgame Empire allows customers to review and rate boardgames. However, there are not enough ratings at this point in time for the ability to sort by rating to be particularly useful. It is planned to enable this functionality in the future, adding another sort option to a fairly extensive list that currently includes: by min or max number of players, by playtime, by age suitability, by price, and alphabetically.  

### Rate Reviews
As reviews are user-generated, they may differ drastically in terms of how helpful they are to others. There is currently no functionality to highlight reviews that a customer found helpful, and this is something that we aim to implement in the future. 

### Multiple Wishlists
For the most part, one wishlist should be sufficient for users. However, there may be cases in which customers would like to organise products into various wishlists. For example, if a customer would like a wishlist for present ideas or unique wishlists for different playgroups, we would like to provide them with this ability.

### Customer Service Chatbot
Customers are invited to email if they have any queries or issues with their orders. In instances where customers have queries that could be dealt with quickly and in real-time, we would like to investigate the practicality of a chatbot. This, we believe, could improve the user experience and save them time as they would not have to partake in a back-and-forth email chain.
